## Features:
- **General video info:**  
  Shows a larger part of the video description than Discord does by default and makes links clickable.  
  Also shows the upload date and view count (configurable).
- [**Return YouTube Dislike:**](https://returnyoutubedislike.com/)  
  Shows the approximate like and dislike count, as well as ratio between them.  
  These numbers are crowdsourced and extrapolated, so they might not be 100% accurate.
- [**SponsorBlock:**](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)  
  Shows timestamps for segments that can be skipped, such as sponsor segments, intros, non-music parts, etc.  
  These timestamps are crowdsourced and might not be 100% accurate.
- [**DeArrow:**](https://dearrow.com/)  
  Shows a crowdsourced thumbnail and title for the video.  
  These are usually made to reduce clickbait, but they also might spoil parts of the video.

<br>

## Regular Usage:
The bot will automatically reply to YouTube links in any channel it has access to.  
If there are multiple links in a single message, it will reply to up to 5 links.  
These automatic replies contain slightly reduced information to reduce spam.  
  
Additionally, there are right-click context menu options to get more detailed information about a video.  
To access these, right-click (or hold on mobile) on a message and select the command under "Apps".

## Slash Commands:
- `/video_info video:<URL or ID> [type:<reduced|all|votes_only|dearrow_only|timestamps_only>]`  
  Shows detailed information about a video, given its URL (supports youtube.com, music.youtube.com, youtu.be or just the video ID).  
  If no type is provided, the bot will default to `reduced`.
- üîí `/configure setting <name> [new_value:<value>]`  
  If no new_value argument is provided, the value of the current setting will be shown.  
  Otherwise, the value of that setting is changed for the current server.  
  Requires the `Manage Server` permission to use.
- üîí `/configure reset`  
  Resets the configuration for the current server to the default values.  
  Shows a confirmation before actually resetting.  
  Requires the `Manage Server` permission to use.

> [!NOTE]  
> Commands prefixed with üîí require special permissions, while others can be used by any member.  
> Arguments surrounded by `[]` are optional.  
> Whatever is surrounded by `<>` is a placeholder and should be replaced with an actual value.  
> If there is a list of options, they are separated by `|` and only one of them can be specified.
